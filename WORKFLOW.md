# Development Workflow
   
   ## Branching Strategy
   1. Create feature branch from main
   2. Make commits with clear messages
   3. Create PR to merge back to main
   
   ## Issue Tracking
   - Use issues to track work
   - Reference issues in commits using #issue_number
   - Close issues when work is complete
